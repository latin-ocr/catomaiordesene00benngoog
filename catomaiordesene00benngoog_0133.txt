:age ise ‘For what ie waging war with the Godn aiter the manner
oi the Giante, ii rebellion against Nature ie not.’ It ie periectly
true that the Latin might mean that; but there ie nothing to
reetrict us to that view. To me the interpretation given in the

'commentary seems the more natural. After deiending it with

classen ior eome years, Ι have recently discovered that it wan
advocated by Nauck nearly hali a century ago.

4. 28. enee· thie ie the reading oi all Mes. but LE. Reid
objecta to ceses on the ground that the quick succeseion of fuissem,
enee, sitisses is un-Ciceronian. This is doubtlese true; but 1 am
inclined to think that perspicuity demands essee, and thie consider·
ation would have been paramount with Cicero.

ὅ. 25. Noenum: noenum (Lachmann’s coniectare ior non enim
oi the Mas.) is commonly explained aa the original oi n5n; but
euch an etymology ie phonetically difficult3 noenum would have
become rafinum (just as early Latin cicilie became vitilia), but not
ubuum, πόη. Scholars now explain πῦπ as consisting oi ηό (a by-
iorm oi πὶ) 4 the asseverative -ηό, seen ior example in Plautus in
Tune, ‘yee‚ you.’

26.p1ueque.· Bernaye’ conjecture ior postque oi the Mes.
Many editors retain postque and interpret‘ both afterwards and

'more especially now’ ;but this doee violence to the language.

Such an idea, moreover, would have been extremely unnatural.

29. fixerat in arce: most Mes. read superat in arce, except that
L and Br have suerat and V has sfferat. Of recent editore,
Anz, Kornitzer‚ Schiche, Sommerbrodt‚ all write suerat in arce.
Miiller and othere read sufferat in arcem, but in arcem suffere
seems a strange expression {or withdrawing irom the walls oi a
town to the citadel.

6. 21. Quor-eun: the reading oi all Mes. but L.

26. quiete et pure atque eleganter: Reid’s note on the use
oi connectivee in this passage hae been widely copied by subse·
quent editore. Reid maintaine that in enumeratione oi the form
Δ 4 (B1 4 32) the 4 outeide the bracket is expressed by et, the 4
incide by atque (ac). But the instancee of et . . . atque cited by
Merguet, Lexikon zu den phssosophischen Schriften, iail in a num·
ber oi cases to support this view.

30. quarto et nonagesimo: Reid writes quarto nonaqesima

12. u. Paonviz Pacuvius (219-129 no.) was one of the two
great tragie writers os Rome, his younger contemporary, Aesius,
being the other. The play of Pacuvius here alluded to is probably
the Dulorestes (‘ Orestes as Captiva ⁹), of which only a few frng-
ments are extant. It represented Orestes as having gone with his
friend, Pylades, to Tauris by order of the Delphis oraole, to carry
off the saomd image 01 Artemis, and so purity himself of the guilt
he had inoumd by the murder of his mother, clytemnestra. The
two friends were seized by the Taurians, whose oustom was to
execute all strangers, and were brought before the king to be put to
death. Euripides in his Iphigenia. in Tauris had previously treated
the same theme.

In de Finibus, V. 22. 63, Cicero cites the passage here referred to:

unusual with perseverare. .

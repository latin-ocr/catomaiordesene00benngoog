30. totum carmen: LPV have this reading. Other Mss. omit
tomum so Miiller. To me it is more likely that totum (especially
after notum) should have dropped out of those Mss. in which it is
lacking, than that it should have been inserted in those Mss. in
which it is found.

27. 29. omnes illi: Reid takes illi as dative. But no such
strong demonstrative referring ιο the old man would be in place
here, whereas illi (referring to the Lacedaemonians) is necessary
with omnes, · otherwise the Latin means the whole audience. It
is evidently to avoid this misconception that ini is used by Cicero.

29. 22. quoniam: the Mss. read cum, which is impossible here.
Lambinus conjectured quod, adopted by Miiller. 1 have adopted
Reid’ s conjecture, quoniam, believing that Cicero would hardly
have written quod id quod. Assuming that Cicero wrote quoniam,
we have only to suppose that this became corrupted to quom (an
easy change, especially as quoniam was often abbreviated as fin).
Cicero probably regularly wrote quom ior the conjunction. The
copyists have changed this regularly to cum. Hence the Ms. cum
in the present passage could easily go back (through quom) to an
original quoniam, as conjectured by Reid. Hale, Cum-Construc-
tions, p. 243 (German ed. p. 302), defends the Ms. reading cum.

80. 24. vi evelluntur: Ι am at a loss to understand the par-
tiality of all recent editors for vix evelluntur, the reading of
P L Br. It is urged that Cicero would not have used vis four
times in five lines; but ii he could use it thrice in this compass‚
he certainly might four times, especially ii the sense demanded.
It is also urged that vi is redundant with evelluntur, since every
act of plucking necessitates the exercise of force. On the other
hand, it is scarcely less than ridiculous and in direct contradiction
of the experience of every lad of enterprise to say that apples are
⁸ plucked with difficulty,' or that they ‘ can hardly be pulled off)

32. possis: the reading of all Mss. except PL, which have
pouit (L posset) adopted by Miiller; but the subjunctive is anom-
alous here, except in the indefinite 2d singular. The 3d singular
would demand the indicative.

mortemque contemnere: these words are bracketed as an
interpolation by Miiller and others. The evidence is hardly suffi-
cient, to my mind, to warrant this attitude.

44 CATO MAIOR DE SENEOTUTE

24. volu'mus quidem certe: Laelius has Just said that they
both hoped (speramus) to become old, but realizing that this is
asserting too much, he at once hastens to quality this speramus by
saying that at least they wished to become old men.

fleri: had the infinitivo depended directly upon speramus, it
would regularly have taken the form nossuturos esse‚· but its con-
struction is determined by volumus.

28. futurum est: different in force from erim erit would have
referred the matter distinctly to the future; futurum est indicates
rather a present prospect, — ⁴ is likely to prove agreeable.’

29. Volumus sane: we really do wish.

30. tamquam longam aliquam viam confeceris, etc.: the
thought troni„ here to the end 01 the sentence is closely modelled
on Plato’s Republic, 1, 328 Ε.

quam nobis quoque ingrediendum ait: on which we too must
enter. This impersonal use of the periphrastic coniugation with a
direct obiect occurs but twice in Cicero.

31. istuc . . . quale uit: to see what sort os thina that is to
which you have come, lit. to see that thino . . . os what sort itis.
(Prolepsis or Anticipation. Α. 81. G. 334, ος G. 4683 Β. 374, 5.)

4. 2. pares cum paribus congregantur: note the reflexive
meaning of the passive conyreqantur. For the thought, cf. the
English ‘ Birds of a feather flock together.’ In Greek the proverb
is as old as Homer3 see Odyss. XVII, 218: ὦς αἰεὶ τὸν ὁμοῖον ἄγει
θεὸς ὥς τὸν ὁμοῖον. French and German also embody the same idea
in trenchant form: ⁴ Qui se ressemble s'assemble ’ς ‘ Gleich und
Gleich gesellt sich gern.’

4. quae . . . deplorare solebant: owing to the interruption
caused by the parenthesis, the writer here repeats the thought
already expresscd in querelis aequalium—complaints which they
used to make, lit. which thinqs they used to complain ‚⁶ quac is
accusative of ⁸ Result Produced ² (Internal Obiect). See note on
quid, p. 1, l. 1.

Ο. Salinator: naval commander in the war against Antiochus,
191 n.c.

Sp. Albinus: consul in 186 n.c.

5. tum . . . tumzpartly . . ‚pamm

6. sine qulbus . . . putarent: without which (they said) they

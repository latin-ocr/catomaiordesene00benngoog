praetexta toqa,· p. ·9, l. 32, prosperis rebus; p. 10, l. 14, secundas
res.

5. ut numquam discederem: ordinarily in Latin we find ue
umquam, ne usquam, ne ullus, etc„ in the sense ‘ in order that never,’
⁸ in order that nowhere,' etc. But here numquam discederem seems
to be used by a species of litotes in the sense, ⁴ be always near' ;
hence ui . . . numquam instead of ne . . . umquam.

quoad possem et liceret: the subjunctive is due to attrac-
tion; liceret seems to imply that Scaevola's advanced age rendered
Cicero's privileges of uncertain duration.

7. commode: happily.

8. prudentia: in the sense of iuris prudentia, as frequently.

9. pontificem Scaevolam: his full name was identical with
that of the augur. He was chosen consul in 95 nc. and was
subsequently made Pontifex Maximus. He lost his life in the
Mat-ian proscription of 82 13.c. As a jurist he was justly held in

15. admodum: with pauci ; the adverb receives greater em·
phasis by being placed after the word which it modifies. cf. p.
7, l. 25, aratum admodum,· p. 23, l. 17, nulli prorsus.

eum sermonem: talk on that subject; cf. p. 34, l. 27, illam
admirationem, ‘admiration of that.’

16. incidere: memini when referring to personal experience
often takes the present infinitive where the English idiom would
lead us to expect the perfect. Cf. Cato Maior, ς 30, Eoo L. Metel-
lum memini ita bonis esse viribus.

17. Attice: see lntrod. ς 2.

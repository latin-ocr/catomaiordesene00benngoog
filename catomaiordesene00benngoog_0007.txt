PREFAGE ’

-ᾡ-

Fon the text of this edition, I have endeavored to
utilize the critical material that has appeared sinos the
publication of Muller's edition (Leipsic, 1879). In the
commentary the aim has been to give only suoh infor-
mation as the student needs for an adequate under-
standing of the text. All discussion of moot points,
whether of text or interpretation, has been relegated
to a Oritioal Appendix.

To Professor Alfred Gudeman‚ of the University of
Pennsylvania„ Professor H. C. Elmer and Mr. Ohas,
L. narbam, of Cornell University‚ I here extend my
acknowledgment for valuable assistance in the preparaf

tion of this volume.

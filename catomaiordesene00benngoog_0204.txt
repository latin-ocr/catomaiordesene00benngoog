54 LAELIUS mr mcmA

agrarian proiecte of the Gracchan party headed by C. Gracchus,
FlaccuS, and Carbo,

31. populo Romano: of course only by those whose sympa-
thies were aristocratic.

32. sociis et Latinis: the interests of these were specially
threatened by the agrarian legislation of Gracchus. The phrase
sociis et Latinis taken together forms the third member in Cicero’s
enumeration, as shown by the fact that et is not used between the
last two members of an enumeration unless between all the other
members. Cicero accordingly means ‘ the allies and (particularly)
the Latins‚' these last being an important element of the socii.

ut . . . pervenisse: i. e. Scipio seems to have become deified

Δ rather than to have descended to the lower world in accordance

with the lot oi 'ordinary mortale.

6. 1. ad superos . . . deos: to heaven, (ae.) to the qods,·
deor, as being in a kind oi explanatory apposition to superos, is
purposely separated from it.

2. ad inferos: supply in sense Manes, ‘ to the lower world.’

3. eis, qul haec, etc.: those who have recently beqzm to set forth
this doctrine ,· haec is explained by the following infinitives‚ interire

and deleri. The reference is to the Epicureans, whose doctrines ·

had only recently begun to be expounded at Rome.

6. nostrorum malorum: our own ancestors ‚⁶ nostrorum is
placed before 'natorum in order to bring out more clearly the
antithesis between Roman and Greek opinion on the subject re-
ferred to. Cf. p. 8, l. 15, nostri maiores,

7. tam religiosa lura: i.e. so scrupulous as is familiar to all.
These rites consisted not merely in the celebration of funeral
obsequies‚ but also in annual libations on the anniversary of the
day of death.

8. nihil ad eos pertinere: that they did not affect them at a11‚·
as subiect of the infinitive understand iura ,⁶ nihil is an adverbial
accusative developed from the ‘ Accusative of Result ’ (Internal
Object) ; cf. de lege agraria, 11, 31, 85, cum (ayer) ad vos pertineat
nihil.

arbitrarentur: this strictly refers to the past and we should
naturally have expected the pluperfect, but in past conditione con-
trary to fact the imperfect is often used to denote continued action.

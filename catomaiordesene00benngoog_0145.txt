PREFAOE

Fon the text of this edition, I have endeavored to
utilize the critical material that has appeared since the
publication of Muller’s edition (Leipsic‚ 1879). In the
commentary the aim has been to give only such infor-
mation as the student needs for an adequate under-
standing of the text. All discussion of moot points,
whether of text or interpretation, has been relegated
to a Critioal Appendix.

In the preparation of the notes I have been espe-
cially aided by the excellent commentaries of Reid,
Strelitz‚ and Meissner.

To Professor Pease, Professor Alfred Gudeman, of
the University of Pennsylvania‚ Professor H. C. Elmer‚
and Mr. Chas. L. Durham, of Cornell University‚ Ι
wish also to extend acknowledgment for valuable

assistance and advice.

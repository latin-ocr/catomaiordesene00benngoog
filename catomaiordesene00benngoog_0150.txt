circle embracing his friend Laelius, L. Furius Philus, Scaevola
(the augur), Fannius, and the poets Lucilius and Terence.
Rumor had it that he assisted Terence in the composition of
his comedies. ι

To LaeliuS, Scipio was attached by ties of the closest friend-
ship. At home and in the field the two were inseparable.
Cicero in the Republic (Ι, 18) tells us that Laelius reverenced
Scipio as divine in consequence of his military prowe88‚ while
Scipio in turn regarded Laelius as a father. Their views of life
and government were identica13 even the observatione on friend-
ship which Cicero in this dialogue puts in the mouth of Laelius
are expressly declared by the latter to be those of his friend.

Politically Scipio was a firm aristocrat. He had been ab·
sent in Spain at the time of the disturbances which culminated
in the murder of Tiberius GracchuS, but on his return he spoke
out boldly and, though married to Sempronia, the sister of
Gracchus, did not hesitate to declare his belief that the agitator
had been justly slain. This was in 133 13.c.‚ and sor the four
remaining years of his life Scipio was the recognized leader of
the aristocratic party. One morning in 129 13.c. he was found
dead in his bed. VVhether he was the victim of violence or died
a natural death was never known. Suspicion pointed to foul
play at the hands of his political opponente. Rumor linked
itself especially with the names os FulviuS, CarbO, and the
younger Gracchus. Of these, Carbo was the most generally
suspected, and is even expressly mentioned by Cicero as the
author of the deed.
